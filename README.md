This folder contains my revision write-up for *Operating Systems*. This was mainly done by re-reading my lecture notes (but mostly the textbook), and summarising what I consider to be the most important points (the book loves a good ramble).

These notes won't be perfect; they're basically a way for me to revise by using the "summarise the content to let it stick in your brain". Nevertheless, if these notes help even one person then that's great.

If you want to open a pull request to change the notes (e.g. fix something wrong), then please only edit the `Operating Systems - Revision.md` file - I'll apply these knock-on changes to the PDF.
# How to view these notes
## Obsidian *\[Recommended]*
As the notes were written within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), they will render best in Obsidian. Links will correctly link, tables, images, and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams will successfully render, and overall you'll be getting the intended experience. 

Simply [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and open the folder you've saved this repository to as a *vault* (Obsidian uses silly names for this for no reason, a vault is just a folder on your device).
## PDF
I've rendered out the [[Operating Systems - Revision|Operating Systems - Revision.md]] file as a PDF using Obsidian's tools. This will likely be sufficient for most people, but tables, Mermaid diagrams, and possibly images may not render as originally intended.
## Online, on GitHub
As this README is written in *Markdown*, GitHub itself provides a rich web-based Markdown renderer. The problem is Obsidian uses it's own flavour of Markdown syntax, and so I believe both links and images will only render as the raw text I typed them as (translation: completely uselessly); and given I \[\[link to other file|often rename links using this syntax in Obsidian]], it may be exceptionally tricky to read. It also doesn't render *inline* $\LaTeX$, though has no problem with $$\text{multiline } \LaTeX$$
Also, the Mermaid diagram renderer is really good. Even better than Obsidian's.
## Your own favourite markdown editor
Of course who am I to limit how you revise? Do with these files what you will. You can even try training an LLM on them to provide personalised marking advice for past papers! I did that last semester for CSec, and it really sucked!!
# Other points of note
- If you see text iwith ban "i" or a "b" weirdly inserted in front of them, it's likely the text was meant to be *italic* or **bold** and I forgot to press `CTRL`.
- Anything in ampersands like this %% is a comment. I don't know if GitHub shows these or if they appear in the PDF. If they are hidden then oh boy bucko you've found a secret. Anyway I need to close this off to let the others know what a comment is. %% \%\% text \%\% is a comment
